# HTML & CSS explanation/notes

I first started with the html, giving the page a title, span elements and buttons.
Initially i  wrapped the minutes- 25 and seconds- 00 in two span elements. But once i got to the javascript i realised it would be better to store the minutes and seconds in a let variable rather than a const. Therefore i chose to leave the span elements empty. 

I left the styling pretty basic as i spent most of the time on the Javascript, the only question i did have though is about the measurement properties that are best used. I mostly see rem and em used because they're more responsive so does that mean we should avoid using pixels?
