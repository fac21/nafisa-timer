# Html explanation/notes

I first started with the html, giving the page a title, span elements and buttons.
Initially i  wrapped the minutes- 25 and seconds- 00 in two span elements. But once i got to the javascript i realised it would be better to store the minutes and seconds in a let variable rather than a const. Therefore i chose to leave the span elements empty.
